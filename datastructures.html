    <h1><u>Data Structures</u></h1>
    
    <h3>What is data?</h3>
        <p>Data is defined as a value or set of values. For example: a name, a number, or a date are all data.</p>

    <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>A variable is a named storage location in programming <u>that holds data </u> which can be changed or manipulated during the execution of a program. Variables can either be
            <u>dynamically</u> or <u>statically</u> typed. For dynamically typed variable, the type does not need to be declared upon creating the variable, and the type can be 
            changed. For statically typed variables, a type must be declared and cannot be later changed.
        </p>

    <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>Data types are classifications that define the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or booleans. Some common data types include:
            <br><br><strong>Boolean:</strong> true or false
            <br><strong>String:</strong> a sequence of characters. Usually defined by double or single quotes. For example: 'I am 19 years old', '5', and 'false' are all strings.
            <br><strong>Number:</strong> numeric values. Most programming languages further classify numbers as either ints (integers) or floats (numbers containing decimals).
            <br><strong>Integer:</strong> whole numbers, such as 1, 3, 19, 100, etc. 
            <br><strong>Float:</strong> aka 'floating point' numbers. Numbers which contain decimals, such as 3.0, 43.2, or 100.1. 
            <br><strong>Character:</strong> a single character, such as !, a, or a blank space. 
            <br><strong>Date:</strong> a calendar date of form YYY-MM-DD.
        </p>

    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
        <p>A data structure is a method for organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and
             used efficiently. It provides a way to manage large amounts of information by enabling operations like 
             searching, sorting, and modifying data with ease. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, 
             stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, each designed to handle specific types of tasks and data relationships.</p>
    
    <h3>Memory</h3>
        <p>Memory in computing refers to the hardware components that store data and instructions for processing by a computer. It is primarily categorized into:
            <br><strong>Primary Memory (RAM):</strong> Fast, volatile storage used by the CPU to hold data and instructions currently in use. Data in RAM is lost when the power is turned off.
            <br><strong>Secondary Memory (Storage):</strong> Non-volatile storage like hard drives or SSDs that retain data even when the computer is powered down, used for long-term data storage.

        </p>
    <h4>Memory Management</h4>
        <p>Memory management is the process by which an operating system or a program efficiently allocates, tracks, and deallocates memory resources to ensure optimal performance and prevent issues like memory leaks or fragmentation. Key aspects include:
            <br>
            <br><strong>Allocation:</strong> Assigning memory space to programs and data when needed. This can be done statically (fixed size at compile-time) or dynamically (adjustable size at runtime).
            <br><strong>Deallocation:</strong> Releasing memory that is no longer in use, making it available for future allocations.
            <br><strong>Garbage Collection:</strong> An automatic memory management feature in some programming languages that identifies and frees memory that is no longer referenced by the program.
            <br><strong>Memory Hierarchy Management:</strong> Optimizing the use of different types of memory (cache, RAM, storage) to balance speed and capacity for efficient data access.
