    <h1><u>Introduction to Algorithms</u></h1>
        <p>An algorithm is a defined set of steps for performing a task.
            Algorithms take in data as an input and return an output after
            a series of steps.</p>
        <h2>Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Algorithms</h2>
        <p><strong>Deterministic</strong> algorithms produce the same output every time given the same input.
            You can imagine this as a straight line path from a specific input to its respective output.
        <br><strong>Non-Deterministic</strong> algorithms may produce different outputs for the same 
        input. Often used in scenarios involving randomness or parallel processing. You can visualize this as
        a trail with many diverging paths. </p>

        <h2>Efficiency</h2>
        <p><strong>Time complexity</strong> and <strong>space complexity</strong> are two important considerations when
            implementing algorithms.<strong>Time complexity</strong> measures how running time of an algorithm increases with size of input. <strong>Space
            complexity</strong> assesses the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size.</p> They are expressed in terms of Big O Notation,
            a mathematical notation that compares the growth of functions. Read more about big O notation <a href="bigO.html" target="blank">here</a>
